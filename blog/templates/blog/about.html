		<h2 id="what">What is Semicolon Math?</h2>
		<p>
			Semicolon Math is an open source platform that offers math contests every month,
			including mock <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/American_Mathematics_Competitions">AMC (American Math Competition)</a>
			and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/American_Invitational_Mathematics_Examination">AIME (American Invitational Mathematics Examination)</a>
			contests meant to simulate the real contests.
			We try to provide some features that competitive programming platforms provide
			such as rating or a large archive of problems to improve the experience.
			Rating has not been implemented yet but will come if there is enough interest in this project.

			The purpose of this Semicolon Math server is create a friendly atmosphere and environment for problem solvers.
			This server can be used to interact with other interested math students and discuss the contest problems AFTER the testing window closes.
			You do not need to be a current or previous competitor to be here.
			Thanks, have fun, and enjoy your stay.

			</li>
			<li>You will have to go to a submit page AFTER the contest (you will be redirected when your attempt finishes) to confirm
				you did not cheat. You may have to submit images of your work for some contests.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 id="format">Contest format</h2>
		<p>Here are the mock contests we plan on offering:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>AMC8:</b> 25 multiple choice problems, 40 minutes time limit, each problem is 1 point, wrong/blank answers are 0 points.</li>
			<li><b>AMC10/12:</b> 25 multiple choice problems, 75 minutes time limit,
				each problem is 6 points, wrong answers are 0 points, blank answers are 1.5 points.</li>
			<li><b>AIME:</b> 15 problems, 3 hours to solve them, integers answers between 000 to 999. Each problem is 1 point,
			and wrong/blank answers mean 0 points.</li>
			<li><b>AIME:</b> 15 problems, 3 hours to solve them, integers answers between 000 to 999. Each problem is 1 point,
			and wrong/blank answers mean 0 points.</li>
			<li><b>Semicolon:</b> A new take on math contests combining the format of competitive programming. 6 problems (usually
				2 "easy", 2 "medium", and 2 "hard" AIME level) with instant feedback, 5 attempts total for a problem, and
				the points you receive from a problem will vary. Users are ranked by their total points and then penalty.
				The penalty for one problem is
